# AutomaticLayoutSwitcher
***(yep, i need a better name)***

---


## Background

My laptop has a german keyboard layout but often I'll use my HHKB (us layout) via bluetooth on it.
I'm lazy and don't want to manually change itevery time. Thats all :)

## Upcoming Features / wishlist

    * some way of automatically activate the script as soon as a new device connects
    * not just bluetooth, also usb
    * not just uuid, search for string in device name
    * add a config file
    * generalize the languanges

    ***WTFPL probably, need to work on this section***
